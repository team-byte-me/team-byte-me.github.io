## A. User Experience Requirements

### i. Inital User Story Ideas

**Task: Learn what all the icons above the terminal mean**

- As a first time user, I want to understand what each button on the site means so that I can use the tool effectively.

**Task: Simulate an DFA and study the results**

- As a user, I want to insert the code for an DFA onto the terminal so that I can simulate a DFA.
- As a user, I want to run the code in the terminal so that the result of the simulation is presented on the screen.
- As a user, I want to arrange my terminal and results windows to my preferred layout so that I can customize my experience to match my preferred workflow.
- As a user, I want to run my Grafstate code and see my results simultaneously so that I can understand what my code is doing.

**Task: Find the documentation for DFA’s**

- As a user, I want to locate the documentation for NFA’s so that I can learn how to simulate the structure properly.
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate the documentation quickly so that I do not lose my train of thought when building a computational structure.
- As a user, I want the documentation to be logically organized so that I can quickly locate the specific pieces of information I need.

**Task View the documentation again after running a simulation**

- As a user, I want to view the documentation again after running a simulation so that I can learn more about the computational structure I am simulating.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the documentation while looking at the computational structure I simulated so that I can gain a better understanding of the structure.

**Task: Understand GrafState’s workflow**

- As a user, I want to be walked through examples of how to use the site so that I have an idea of how to be productive in the application.

### ii. Most Relevant User Stories

#### User Story - Signifier Overhaul

> As a first time user, I want to understand the affordances of each button on the page so that I can use the tool as intended.

In The Design of Everyday Things, Norman suggests that a design should “make things visible, including the conceptual model of the system, the alternative actions, and the results of actions” (Norman 188). This user story is important to include because the buttons on the site play a key role in the users’ formation of a conceptual model. Norman also emphasizes that “as much as possible, it should operate without instructions or labels” (Norman 188). As a result, we should ensure that buttons are made in a way that does not immediately send the user to the documentation in order to find an explanation.

#### User Story - Split Windows

> As a user, I want to arrange my terminal and results windows to my preferred layout so that I can customize my experience to match my preferred workflow.

This is a relevant user story because it provides the user with as much flexibility as possible while still defining a page structure. In Designing the User Interface, Shneiderman includes keeping users in control as part of the Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design, and explains that “experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions” (Shneiderman 72). Since the terminal and results pages are where users will simulate computational structures, enabling them to restructure the layout of these pages keeps them in control of the main interaction points in the interface.

#### User Story - User Tour

> As a user, I want to be walked through examples of how to use the site so that I have an idea of how to be productive in the application.

This user story is important because it will encompass the main use case of the site. Since it is a tool for visualizing math, GrafState’s main feature is enabling users to code and run simulations. In Understanding the Roles and Uses of Web Tutorials, the authors studied users’ comments on why they use website tutorials, and concluded that “tutorials provide in-task help for users in the midst of performing a task that they don’t know how to complete” (306). In case a user cannot figure out how to use the main task performed on GrafState, providing a tutorial can help them to learn how to do so.
