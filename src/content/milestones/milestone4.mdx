### 2. User Stories

#### User Story - Signifier Overhaul

> As a first time user, I want to understand the affordances of each button on the page so that I can use the tool as intended.

When designing our prototype, we have taken special care to address what we felt were inadequate signifiers for accomplishing the task of creating and editing computational structures in Grafstate. We have done this by implementing the following design elements into our final prototype:
- **Visual Signifiers and Icons:** Each button in the interface is accompanied by a visual cue or icon that provides a visual representation of its purpose. These icons are designed to be easily recognizable and associated with their corresponding actions. For example, a "plus" icon is used for adding a new terminal, “magnifying glass” icons for zooming, and a "play button" icon for running a terminal’s code. 
- **Button Labeling:** In addition to the visual cues, we have included clear and concise labels for each button. The labels are descriptive and use simple language that aligns with the expected action. For instance, instead of using technical terms, we use labels like "Run," "Back," or “Info” to clearly convey the functionality of each respective button. We took this approach in an effort to eliminate ambiguity and help users quickly grasp the intended purpose of each button. A study performed by Susan Wiedenbeck supports our decision to do so. She found that the results of her study "suggests that the labels were the element that aided learning" (Widenbeck 79).
- **Button Placement and Grouping:** We have carefully considered the placement and grouping of buttons within the interface. Buttons with similar functions are grouped together and positioned in a logical sequence, following the natural flow of the user's workflow. For example, buttons related to adding a new terminal in an already existing window or editing a window’s text size are grouped together, while buttons not directly related to an individual window like the run button or tutorial button are placed in a separate header section.

#### User Story - Split Windows

> As a user, I want to arrange my terminal and results windows to my preferred layout so that I can customize my experience to match my preferred workflow.

To address the user's ability to customize their experience by arranging terminal and results windows in their preferred layout, our solution focuses on providing a flexible interface with design elements that empower users to personalize their workflow effectively. We have done so utilizing the following design elements:
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Our prototype incorporates a drag-and-drop interface that allows users to easily rearrange the terminal and results windows according to their preferred layout. Users can organize their workspace by clicking and holding on a tabs' title bar, then dragging it to the desired position.
- **Snap-to-Grid Functionality:** To assist users in aligning and arranging the windows precisely, our prototype includes a snap-to-grid functionality. When users drag a window close to another, the windows automatically align with the grid, ensuring a neat and organized layout. This feature eliminates the need for manual adjustments, saving time and effort for the user.
- **Window Sizing Options:** Our prototype provides users with various window sizing options to further enhance their customization capabilities. Users can easily resize terminal and result windows by clicking and dragging the window borders, allowing them to adjust the dimensions to fit their preferred workspace setup.
- **Window Docking:** To offer users more flexibility in managing their windows, our prototype includes window docking functionality. Users can dock the terminal and results windows together, side by side or in a tabbed interface, depending on their preference. This feature enables users to switch between different views or focus on specific aspects of their workflow seamlessly.

#### User Story - User Tour

**[Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/9QeafCpZkYSI9pQ73JzRPT/Milestone-4?node-id=14-4543&scaling=scale-down&page-id=4%3A1794&starting-point-node-id=14%3A4543&show-proto-sidebar=1)**

> As a user, I want to be walked through examples of how to use the site so that I can understand how to be productive in the application.

Our solution focuses on creating a user tour that demonstrates how to create a computational structure in order to help address any confusion that a user may have. The user tour serves as a step-by-step walkthrough, providing the user with clear instructions and visual examples to help them grasp the functionality and basic usage of the site. We implemented the following design elements to create the tour:
- **Interactive Interface:** The user tour incorporates an interactive interface that guides users through each step. It utilizes elements like overlays and highlighting to draw attention to specific areas and features of the application. We provide visual cues and clear instructions in an effort to ensure that users can easily follow along and understand the actions they need to take.
- **Interactive Examples and Simulations:** To enhance the learning experience, the user tour incorporates interactive examples and simulations. Users are presented with a practical scenario where they can actively interact with the site to create and run a computational structure and see the results of their actions in real-time. 
- **Clear Explanations:** Alongside the visual demonstrations, the user tour provides clear explanations and contextual help. Each step is accompanied by concise descriptions that outline the purpose and significance of the actions being performed.

## B. Testing Protocol

### 1. Protocol Description

**Research Question:** Does the user tour along with the updated signifiers enable new users to become familiar with the site more effectively, and does the new window-like layout give experienced users more control over the interface?

**Objectives, Methodology, and Organization:** 
- We will use the survey methodology to test our prototype. In Designing the User Interface, the author reports that “User surveys are familiar, inexpensive, and generally acceptable companions for usability tests” (Schneiderman 159). Since our population of study consists of college students and we would like to get a reasonably large number of participants, the familiarity of surveys will make it easier for students to participate in the study while managing a busy schedule. Surveys are also an effective way to standardize the data we receive from each participant. This will help us to draw concrete conclusions from the data we collect.
- Participants will be split into three groups. One will consist of students who are already familiar with Grafstate, while the other two include students who are not familiar with Grafstate but have completed two computer science courses with a programming component. Changing the appearance of an interface has different effects on experienced users as compared to new users. Therefore, these two groups will receive different surveys. Questions for experienced users will examine how much control the user feels that they have over the interface, while questions for new users are concerned with learning how to use the site.
- The participants who have not used Grafstate will be split into two groups. One group will test the current interface, while the other will test our prototype. We will ask the participants to perform tasks on the site that are related to our problem of study. After completing each task, the participant will be asked to fill out the survey. Both groups will answer the same questions, since we will compare their responses directly.
- Experienced users have used the current version of Grafstate extensively, and our goal is to provide them with more control over the interface. We will send them the prototype, ask them to interact with the window-like layout, and report their impressions in a survey. This survey will help us determine whether the new layout keeps the user in control of the interface more effectively than the current version of Grafstate.


### 2. Procedure Description:

#### Informed Consent:
- Before testing our prototype, we will ensure that we obtain informed consent from all of our participants by considering the recommendations from the Belmont Report. In the report, it is stated that the “consent process can be analyzed as containing three elements: information, comprehension, and voluntariness.” We will give the potential research participants an informed consent form that will inform the participant of the purpose, expected duration/time, and the procedures of our survey. The form will also provide information on the participant’s rights to decline to participate in the survey, the participant’s rights to withdraw from the survey, the potential risks to the participants, the benefits of the study, the participant’s confidentiality rights, and our contact information. Each step of our procedure outlined below will be presented to the participant on the informed consent form, as we do not believe that knowledge of this information will impact our survey results. 
- To ensure that the participant has comprehended the information, we will also pre-record a video that outlines all pertinent information for each group of participants. In the article “Innovative Ethics: Using Animated Videos When Soliciting Informed Consent of Young People for Online Surveys,” Lauren B. McInroy explains that, “it is crucial that consent materials be provided in a straightforward, user-friendly way that is appealing to young people and uses age-appropriate language. It is recommended that animated videos always be accompanied by traditional textual informed consent materials…” (Mclnroy 124). We will also reiterate our contact information so that we can explain anything that the participant did not understand in the video. 
- To get enough volunteers for the study, we will send an email to students in the School of Computing at UGA, asking them if they are interested in participating in our study. In addition, we will ask Professor Hollingsworth to encourage his students to participate in the study at the end of the academic semester, as those students will be experienced Grafstate users. We will also ask other professors in the CS department to encourage their students who are new Grafstate users to participate in our study.
#### The Procedure:

Our surveys incorporate some aspects of the System Usability Scale, an industry standard scale for gauging usability. In "An Empirical Evaluation of the System Usability Scale," the authors report that the scale was developed to “allow the usability practitioner to quickly and easily assess the usability of a given product or service” (Bangor 574). Our surveys contain variations of the recommended questions. We made minor adjustments to these questions in order to address each user story. Our questions are therefore tailored to the design changes we recommended and our application, Grafstate, and include the assessment ability from the SUS. 

##### New Users:
- We will split all new Grafstate users evenly into two groups. One group will interact with our prototype, while the other will interact with the current version of Grafstate. The group that has been assigned to use our prototype will be asked to complete the newly created user tour in its entirety. We will ask each participant to run two simulations of a commonly used computational structure, called a DFA. We will also ask them to keep a count of the number of times that they feel confused, disoriented, or are unable to find what they are looking for. After completing the tasks, participants will fill out one of the surveys below:
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeujArYYzfxHxqTdV5Y8mmhmCWwENQhZMdNUQdBLntTyJl59w/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Group 1: Our Prototype</a>
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6HIo0i9KFqcLGO8uj-IoAYxmdChvmRrEjT0Mb_BNSsZllHQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Group 2: Current Version of Grafstate</a>

##### Experienced Users:
- Participants who are familiar with Grafstate (students who have completed the Theory of Computing) will be asked to run two DFA’s, and resize the windows to match their preferred workflow. After doing so, they will be asked to complete the survey below:
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfb0lgXqJ0n30HyFSPUSTtVnmOusx0iL1B_naYtehYA4RYLjg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Experienced User Survey</a>
 
#### Organization & Analysis
We will use Google Forms to create and distribute the surveys. Responses will be organized using the graphs that Google Forms provides. Below is an example of the graphs we will use for further analysis.
![Graph for Survey Results](/graph.png)

For experienced users, the more responses that agree with the statements in the survey, the more confidently we can conclude that the window-like layout helps to keep users in control.

For new users, we will compare the percentages of responses between both groups using the graphs like the one above. We will also compare the average number of instances of confusion. To determine whether there is a consistent and pronounced difference between the responses from the two groups in favor of our prototype, we will perform a t-test. 

According to an article on the topic of t-tests from the National Library of Medicine, “While the one-sample t-test allows you to test the statistic of a single set of numbers against a specific numeric value, the two-sample t-test allows testing the values of a statistic between two groups” (Wadhwa, 4). Since we are comparing the results between two groups for new users, we will perform a two sample t-test. For the experienced user group, a one sample t-test will be performed to determine whether the statistical difference is significant. We will use random and independent samples and assume nearly normal conditions. 

The responses to each question will be mapped to three buckets before performing the t-test. Bucket 1 combines strongly agree and agree, bucket 2 is neutral, and bucket 3 is for disagree and strongly disagree.

#### T-Test for New Users:
Responses for the instances of confusion will also be split into three buckets. Bucket one for 0 instances, bucket two for 1 to 3 instances, and bucket three for 4 or more instances. Our alternative hypothesis is that participants using our prototype will fall under buckets 1 and 2 more than those using the current version of Grafstate.

For the questions in the survey, our alternative hypothesis is that more participants using our prototype will fall under bucket 1 than those using the current version of Grafstate.

#### T-Test for Experienced Users:
The goal for this t-test is to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between positive and negative responses to the questions in the survey. Responses will be split into 3 buckets, like the t-test for new users. Our alternative hypothesis is that the majority of responses will fall under bucket 1.

#### Overview of How to Perform the T-Test:
We will use prior knowledge from statistics courses to perform the test. The steps include formulating a null and alternative hypothesis, determining a critical value, calculating the test statistic, and checking whether the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than the critical value. If this is the case, then we reject the null hypothesis. We must then ensure that the statistically significant difference is in favor of our prototype.

#### Pandemic Procedure
Since our participants can complete the entire process from home, there are no additional precautions that need to be taken to make this study safe during a pandemic. That being said, since we will not be interacting with our participants in person, it is very important to provide them with contact information so that they can ask us any additional questions.
