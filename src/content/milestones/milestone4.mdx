### 2. User Stories

#### User Story - Signifier Overhaul

> As a first time user, I want to understand the affordances of each button on the page so that I can use the tool as intended.

In The Design of Everyday Things, Norman suggests that a design should “make things visible, including the conceptual model of the system, the alternative actions, and the results of actions” (Norman 188). This user story is important to include because the buttons on the site play a key role in the users’ formation of a conceptual model. Norman also emphasizes that “as much as possible, it should operate without instructions or labels” (Norman 188). As a result, we should ensure that buttons are made in a way that does not immediately send the user to the documentation in order to find an explanation.

#### User Story - Split Windows

> As a user, I want to arrange my terminal and results windows to my preferred layout so that I can customize my experience to match my preferred workflow.

This is a relevant user story because it provides the user with as much flexibility as possible while still defining a page structure. In Designing the User Interface, Shneiderman includes keeping users in control as part of the Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design, and explains that “experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions” (Shneiderman 72). Since the terminal and results pages are where users will simulate computational structures, enabling them to restructure the layout of these pages keeps them in control of the main interaction points in the interface.

#### User Story - User Tour

**[Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/9QeafCpZkYSI9pQ73JzRPT/Milestone-4?node-id=14-4543&scaling=scale-down&page-id=4%3A1794&starting-point-node-id=14%3A4543&show-proto-sidebar=1)**

> As a user, I want to be walked through examples of how to use the site so that I can understand how to be productive in the application.

This user story is important because it will encompass the main use case of the site. Since it is a tool for visualizing math, GrafState’s main feature is enabling users to code and run simulations. In Understanding the Roles and Uses of Web Tutorials, the authors studied users’ comments on why they use website tutorials, and concluded that “tutorials provide in-task help for users in the midst of performing a task that they don’t know how to complete” (306). If a user is struggling to complete the task of simulating a computational structure, providing a tutorial can help them to learn how to do so.

## B. Testing Protocol

### 1. Protocol Description

**Research Question:** Does the user tour along with the updated signifiers enable new users to understand how the site works more effectively, and does the new window-like layout give experienced users more control over the interface?

**Objectives, Methodology, and Organization:** 
- We will use a mixed methodology involving surveys, observations, and interviews. Since our participants will have different levels of experience, it is necessary to adjust our approach to study each group effectively. The two major groups of participants include students who are already familiar with Grafstate, and students who have completed two computer science courses that include a programming component but have not yet taken a course that uses Grafstate. Changing the appearance of an interface has different effects on experienced users as compared to new users. Therefore, we will use the methodology that is best suited for each group.
- Participants will be split into three groups. One will consist of students who are already familiar with Grafstate, while the other two include students who are not familiar with Grafstate but have completed two computer science courses with a programming component. Changing the appearance of an interface has different effects on experienced users as compared to new users. Therefore, these two groups will receive different surveys. Questions for experienced users will examine how much control the user feels that they have over the interface, while questions for new users are concerned with learning how to use the site.
- The participants who have not used Grafstate will be split into two groups. One group will test the current interface, while the other will test our prototype. We will ask the participants to perform tasks on the site that are related to our problem of study. After completing each task, the participant will be asked to fill out the survey. Both groups will answer the same questions, since we will compare their responses directly. 
- Experienced users have used the current version of Grafstate extensively, and our goal is to provide them with more control over the interface. We will send them the prototype, ask them to interact with the window-like layout, and report their impressions in a survey. This survey will help us determine whether the new layout keeps the user in control of the interface more effectively than the current version of Grafstate.


### 2. Procedure Description:

#### Informed Consent:
- Before testing our prototype, we will ensure that we obtain informed consent from all of our participants by considering the recommendations from the Belmont Report. In the report, it is stated that the “consent process can be analyzed as containing three elements: information, comprehension and voluntariness.” We will give the potential research participants an informed consent form that will inform the participant of the purpose, expected duration/time, and procedures of our survey, as well as information on the participant’s rights to decline participating in the survey, the participant’s rights to withdraw from the survey, the potential risks to the participants, the benefits of the study, the participant’s confidential rights, and our contact information. Each step of our procedure that is outlined below will be presented to the participant on the informed consent form, as we do not believe information about the procedure given to the participant will impact our survey results.
- To ensure that the participant has comprehended the information, we will pre-record a video that outlines all pertinent information for each group of participants. Experienced Grafstate users, who will not be directly observed during the study, will be given our contact information so that we can answer any additional questions they may have. New Grafstate users will also view a video before the observational study begins, the person conducting the interview will answer any questions before the study begins.
- **TODO: ADD this part for number of participants**
#### The Procedure:

Our surveys incorporate some aspects of the System Usability Scale, an industry standard scale for gauging usability. In An Empirical Evaluation of the System Usability Scale, the authors report that the scale was developed to “allow the usability practitioner to quickly and easily assess the usability of a given product or service” (Bangor, 574). Our surveys contain variations of the recommended questions. We made minor adjustments to the recommended questions to address each user story. Our questions are therefore tailored to the design changes we recommended and our application, Grafstate, with the assessment ability from the SUS. 

##### New Users:
- We will split all new Grafstate users evenly into two groups. One group will interact with our prototype, while the other will interact with the current version of Grafstate. The group that has been assigned to use our prototype will be asked to complete the newly created user tour in its entirety. We will ask each participant to run two simulations of a commonly used computational structure, called a DFA. We will also ask them to keep a count of the number of times that they feel confused, disoriented, or are unable to find what they are looking for. After completing the tasks, participants will fill out one of the surveys below:
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeujArYYzfxHxqTdV5Y8mmhmCWwENQhZMdNUQdBLntTyJl59w/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Group 1: Our Prototype</a>
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeujArYYzfxHxqTdV5Y8mmhmCWwENQhZMdNUQdBLntTyJl59w/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Group 2: Current Version of Grafstate</a>

##### Experienced Users:
- Participants who are familiar with Grafstate (students who have completed the Theory of Computing) will be asked to run two DFA’s, and resize the windows to match their preferred workflow. After doing so, they will be asked to complete the survey below:
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfb0lgXqJ0n30HyFSPUSTtVnmOusx0iL1B_naYtehYA4RYLjg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Experienced User Survey</a>
 
#### Organization & Analysis
We will use Google Forms to create and distribute the surveys. Responses will be organized using the graphs that Google Forms provides. Below is an example of the graphs we will use for further analysis.
![Graph for Survey Results](/graph.png)

For experienced users, the more responses that agree with the statements in the survey, the more confidently we can conclude that the window-like layout helps to keep users in control.

For new users, we will compare the percentages of responses between both groups using the graphs like the one above. We will also compare the average number of instances of confusion. To determine whether there is a consistent and pronounced difference between the responses from the two groups in favor of our prototype, we will perform a one-tailed t-test. 

According to an article on the topic of t-tests from the National Library of Medicine, “While the one-sample t-test allows you to test the statistic of a single set of numbers against a specific numeric value, the two-sample t-test allows testing the values of a statistic between two groups” (Wadhwa, 4). Since we are comparing the results between two groups for new users, we will perform a two sample t-test. For the experienced user group, a one sample t-test will be performed to determine whether the statistical difference is significant. We will use random and independent samples and assume nearly normal conditions. 

The responses to each question will be mapped to three buckets before performing the t-test. Bucket 1 combines strongly agree and agree, bucket 2 is neutral, and bucket 3 is for disagree and strongly disagree.

#### T-Test for New Users:
Responses for the instances of confusion will also be split into three buckets. Bucket one for 0 instances, bucket two for 1 to 3 instances, and bucket three for 4 or more instances. Our alternative hypothesis is that participants using our prototype will fall under buckets 1 and 2 more than those using the current version of Grafstate.

For the questions in the survey, our alternative hypothesis is that more participants using our prototype will fall under bucket 1 than those using the current version of Grafstate.

#### T-Test for Experienced Users:
The goal for this t-test is to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between positive and negative responses to the questions in the survey. Responses will be split into 3 buckets, exactly like the t-test for new users. Our alternative hypothesis is that the majority of responses will fall under bucket 1.

#### Overview of How to Perform the T-Test:
We will use prior knowledge from statistics courses to perform the test. The steps include formulating a null and alternative hypothesis, determining a critical value, calculating the test statistic, and checking whether the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than the critical value. If this is the case, then we reject the null hypothesis. We must then ensure that the statistical significant difference is in favor of our prototype.

#### Pandemic Procedure
Since our participants can complete the entire process from home, there are no additional precautions that need to be taken to make this study safe during a pandemic. That being said, since we will not be interacting with our participants in person, it is very important to provide them with contact information so that they can ask us any additional questions.
