## Introduction

Grafstate is a website that plays a crucial role in helping UGA students master the Theory of Computing (CSCI 2670). It provides an interactive platform for viewing diagrams, working on assignments, and coding simulations of logical structures. However, the current design of Grafstate poses significant challenges for new users. The interface is cluttered and unintuitive, making it difficult for students to navigate and focus on the material itself. In this proposal, we will outline the problems with the current design and suggest ways to improve it.

## Current Challenges

New users of Grafstate face several challenges when attempting to use the platform. These include:

- **A steep learning curve**: The current interface is not user-friendly and requires significant time and effort to learn.
- **Confusing icons**: The unique icons used on the platform do not provide clear signifiers of their intended actions, creating anti-affordances.
- **Lack of syntax error signifiers**: There are no clear indicators of syntax errors in Grafstate code, causing significant disruptions to the learning process.
- **Unintuitive layout**: The large terminal interface may confuse users who are not familiar with a UNIX-like environment, and the landing page does not provide clear direction for what the user should be able to do.

## Impact on Learning

The difficulties involved with using Grafstate can have a significant impact on students' ability to learn the course material effectively. This can lead to lower GPAs and a lower level of proficiency with the subject matter. In addition, other factors such as classroom composition, instructor availability, and out-of-class resources can also affect student performance. However, by addressing the challenges with the current design, we can help ensure that students have a positive and effective learning experience.

## Proposed Solutions

To address the challenges with the current design, we propose the following solutions:

- **Streamline the interface**: By simplifying the interface and reducing clutter, we can make the platform more user-friendly and intuitive.
- **Improve signifiers**: Clear signifiers for icons and syntax errors can help new users better understand the platform and its intended actions.
- **Revise documentation**: By revising the documentation to be more informative and user-friendly, we can help new users navigate the platform more effectively.
- **Provide clear direction**: The landing page should provide clear direction on what the user should be able to do, and feature descriptions of features that are relevant to first-time users.

By implementing these solutions, we can create a more user-friendly and effective learning experience for UGA students using Grafstate.

<!-- Grafstate is the main website that UGA students reference when taking the Theory of Computing (CSCI 2670). It helps visualize mathematics by affording viewing diagrams, working on assignments, and coding simulations of logical structures. Learning about theoretical computer science is challenging, and students need a tool that will operate as smoothly as possible so that they can focus on the material itself. Professors benefit from a tool that is convenient to use during lectures, because running simulations while explaining the content will aid visual learners.

New Grafstate users must overcome a considerable learning curve to be able to use the site effectively. After logging in, users are presented with a large terminal which takes up the majority of the screen, along with unique icons signifying affordances that new users might not understand. The terminal and icon signifiers create anti-affordances, because new users might not associate them with their respective intended action. Additional anti-affordances include a lack of signifiers for syntax errors in Grafstate code. These bugs cause significant disruptions. The large terminal may confuse users who do not have experience working in a UNIX-like environment, and makes understanding what to do with the terminal before reading the documentation very difficult to do. Additionally, the signifiers in the documentation do not afford an understanding of where users can locate the answer to their questions. The landing page also contains descriptions of features that a first time user would likely not be interested in, such as how to pin sections to the margin. The landing page does not provide clear direction for what the user should be able to do. These icons, confusing documentation, and an unintuitive layout demonstrate anti-affordances because they do not allow for easy navigation through the site. This results in a difficult experience for many students, which distracts them from learning the course material.

Other factors may also affect the ability for students to use the platform effectively. Some of these include classroom composition, instructor availability, student self-efficacy, performance in prerequisite courses, student personality, collaborative teamwork, and out-of-class resources. Students are affected the most by the difficulties involved with working with the website, because they will not be able to learn the course content effectively. This may affect their GPA, as well as their level of proficiency with course material. -->
